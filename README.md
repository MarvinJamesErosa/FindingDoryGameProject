# FindingDoryGameProject
Finding Dory is a 2D free-to-play arcade-style adventure and educational computer game, a great way to blend entertainment with learning. The player must control Bloat The Pupperfish through a series of pipes without hitting them or the ground. Once Bloat hits either, the player may play a fish quiz to save and continue their game progress.
